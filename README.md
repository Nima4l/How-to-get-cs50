## How can i get that:
first, you need to sign in to `edx.org`.
and next go to<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x"> this link</a> when you see `enroll` click that pay attention you don't need to buy a certificate for edx because Harvard gives you certific ates too so you don't need edx.org. so you should click Access this course to continue. Congratulations you got the course! and next, you just see videos and answer the problem sets when you finish all of them you can request to get the certificate.
